Notes of hwk tasks for hwk 0 - very basic intro to python.

The first 4 tasks are trivial.  Note the difference between statements
and expressions in Python - same as in most other languages. 

Data structures begin at task 5: 

Python provides some simple data structures for grouping together
multiple values, and integrates them with the rest of the
language. These data structures are called collections. We start with
sets.

Note the use of | and & for union and intersection, respectively.

Set methods S.update and S.intersection_udate (intersect a set with
another collection, removing from the set all elements not in the
other collection: of S = {1, 3, 4} then after
S.intersection_update({4, 5, 6}) S has {4, 5, 6})

Suppose two variables are bound to the same value. A mutation to the
value made through one variable is seen by the other variable. 

>>> T=S

>>> T.remove(5) 

>>> S {6} 

This behavior reflects the fact that Python stores only one copy of
the underlying data structure. After Python executes the assignment
statement T=S, both T and S point to the same data structure.

Can copy data structures if want to avoid above behavior.


Set Comprehension (because its value is a set)

TASK # 8 was nice!

TASK # 9 also nice: three_digits_set = {x*base**2 + y*base + z for x
in digits for y in digits for z in digits}

You can use sum(.) on a collection of lists, obtaining the
concatenation of all the lists, by providing [] as the second
argument.
